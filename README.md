Web Development Project Report

1. Introduction
   The purpose of this web development project is to create a personal website for Yashjeet Singh, focusing on his hobby of watching movies. The website serves as a platform for sharing movie reviews, recommendations, and personal reflections on various genres. Technologies used include HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements.

2. Design Choices
   Header and Navigation:
   The <header> element was chosen to prominently display the site title and navigation links. This enhances accessibility and provides a consistent layout across all pages. The <nav> element within the header ensures semantic clarity and easy navigation for users.

Styling and Theme:
A dark theme was implemented using #121212 for the background and #f0f0f0 for text color. This choice was made to create a visually appealing contrast that is easy on the eyes, suitable for long reading sessions. The main content area (<main>) has a transparent background to subtly overlay the background video without obstructing it, while <section> elements maintain opaque backgrounds to improve content readability.

Responsive Design:
Media queries (@media) were utilized to ensure responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes. Flexbox and grid layout techniques were employed to maintain a structured and adaptable design that adjusts seamlessly from desktops to mobile devices.

3. Implementation Process Reflection
   Structuring the HTML:
   HTML was structured to maximize semantic markup (<section>, <article>, <aside>) for better accessibility and SEO. Challenges included ensuring proper nesting of elements and maintaining a logical document structure, which was overcome by frequent validation and testing.

CSS Styling Strategy:
CSS styles were organized into a separate styles.css file to promote modularity and maintainability. Selectors were used efficiently to target specific elements without unnecessary repetition. This approach adheres to the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle, enhancing code clarity and ease of maintenance.

Multimedia Integration:
Integration of multimedia elements such as embedded YouTube trailers (<iframe>) and hobby-related images enhanced user engagement. Careful consideration was given to image sizes and loading times to optimize performance without compromising visual quality.

4. GitHub Usage
   Task Management (GitHub Projects):
   GitHub Projects was employed to manage tasks throughout the development lifecycle. Tasks were organized into boards with columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) to track progress effectively. This facilitated collaboration and allowed for transparent project management.

Version Control (Git Commit History):
Git was used for version control, with a structured approach to commits. Feature branches were created for new features or fixes, ensuring a clean and organized commit history. Branch merging and pull requests were utilized to review and integrate changes seamlessly.

5. Conclusion
   In conclusion, this web development project successfully created a functional and visually appealing personal website for Yashjeet Singh. The use of semantic HTML, thoughtful CSS styling, and effective multimedia integration contributed to a user-friendly experience. GitHub provided robust tools for task management and version control, enhancing project collaboration and development efficiency.
